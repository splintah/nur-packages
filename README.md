# nur-packages
My personal collection of derivations, currently ranging from packaging small niche projects to prereleases of popular ones though more might be added in the future.
Available via the [Nix User Repository](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) with `pkgs.nur.repos.syberant.package-you-want-to-install`.
Note that the NUR is not checked for malicious content so you should carefully check the software you're installing.
See the [documentation](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#installation) there for more details on how to use the NUR.
